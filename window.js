    // the head of the inbox, but we're filtering the inbox for our specific

    // Why does reconnect work? Well, one side is going to realize that the
    // connection is broken and close it. If it is the client side then it will
    // open a new connection and the server will know to replace it. It will
    // destroy its Conduit and give the window to a new conduit. It will then
    // send the reconnect message (or rebuffer or something) and the client will
    // reply.
    //
    // If the server detects disconnection, then the client might keep on
    // chatting with a half-open socket indefinately. We might want to add a
    // keep-alive receiver that will destroy the socket, or we might decide to
    // add keep-alive to this here, splitting it out only if we decide that we
    // want to have alternative flow-control methods.
    //
    // Actually, for now we could have keep-alive as a seprate receiver. It has
    // a Signal you can wire to destroy your Conduit. Simpler and we can
    // optimize it away if it is too expensive. (Rather optimize Procession so
    // we're not shy about creating pipelines.)
    //
    // Anyway, with a keep-alive, the server can disconnect and just chill. The
    // client can timeout and then go through the reconnect. It is not going to
    // empty it's queue until it gets a flush and it won't get one off the
    // closed socket.
